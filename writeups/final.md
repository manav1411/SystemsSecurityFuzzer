Your fuzzer design and functionality (around 1-2 pages)

This section should explain, in a readable manner:

How your fuzzer works. Detailed description on;
The different mutation strategies you use.

How your harness works.

All of your fuzzers' capabilities
What kinds of bugs your fuzzer can find
What improvements can be made to your fuzzer (Be honest. We won't dock marks for things you didn't implement. This shows reflection and understanding)
If you attempt any bonus marks - How your fuzzer achieves these bonus marks.
It is insufficient if the document merely states "our fuzzer injects random values and finds bugs". We want details that show deep understanding.
